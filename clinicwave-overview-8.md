## Domain Driven Design (DDD)

### Introduction to DDD
- `Domain Driven Design (DDD)` is a software design approach that focuses on modeling software around the core business domain and its associated data.
- The primary goal of DDD is to create a common understanding of the domain between developers and domain experts, leading to better software that aligns with the business needs.

### Key Concepts of DDD
1. `Domain`: The subject area or core business for which the software system is being developed.
2. `Subdomain`: A specific functional area within the broader domain, representing a distinct business capability.
3. `Bounded Context`: A logical boundary that separates and encapsulates a specific subdomain, ensuring that its concepts, models, and terminology are consistent and isolated from other subdomains.
4. `Ubiquitous Language`: A common language shared by developers and domain experts, fostering effective communication and a shared understanding of the domain.

### Identifying Domains and Subdomains
- Start by identifying the main domain, which represents the core business area of the application.
- Divide the domain into independent subdomains, each representing a distinct business capability or functional area.
- `Subdomains should have unique identifiers and single-responsibility functionalities`.
- The subdomains, when aggregated, should form the main domain.

### Implementing DDD with Bounded Contexts
- `Bounded Contexts define the boundaries for each subdomain, ensuring clear separation and isolation of concerns`.
- Within a Bounded Context, all components (entities, services, repositories) related to a subdomain should be encapsulated.
- `Bounded Contexts prevent code sharing between subdomains, enforcing communication through well-defined interfaces or APIs`.
- If a subdomain requires data or functionality from another subdomain, it should communicate via network calls or APIs, rather than directly sharing code.
- Non-functional entities (e.g., communication types, addresses) can be shared across Bounded Contexts as common domains or services.

### Challenges and Patterns in DDD
- `Complex relationships and data dependencies between subdomains can pose challenges during implementation`.
- `When migrating from a monolithic architecture (brownfield), decomposing existing relationships into Bounded Contexts can be complex`.
- Patterns like the `Triangular Pattern` can help with gradual decomposition of monolithic applications into microservices.

### Next Steps
- Start coding and implementing DDD.
- Explore additional aspects of DDD implementation, such as:
- Outbound and inbound communication between Bounded Contexts
- Interface segregation and design
- Package structure (layer-based or package-based)
- Handling challenges using DDD patterns (e.g., `Decorator Pattern`, `Value Object Pattern`)
